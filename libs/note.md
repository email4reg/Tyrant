* average_degree_connectivity:  
Compute the average degree connectivity of graph. see also neighbors_average_degree()
* node_connectivity:  
Returns an approximation for node connectivity for a graph or digraph G.  
Node connectivity is equal to the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to disconnect G or render it trivial. By Mengerâ€™s theorem, this is equal to the number of node independent paths (paths that share no nodes other than source and target).
